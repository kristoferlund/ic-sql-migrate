## Features

- üöÄ **Multi-Database Support**: Works with SQLite (via `ic-rusqlite`) and Turso databases
- üì¶ **Compile-Time Embedding**: Migration files are embedded into your binary at compile time
- üîÑ **Automatic Migration**: Tracks and applies migrations automatically on canister init and upgrade
- üîí **Transactional**: All migrations run in transactions for safety
- üèóÔ∏è **ICP Native**: Designed specifically for Internet Computer canisters

## Prerequisites

**IMPORTANT**: You must enable exactly one database feature (`sqlite` or `turso`) for this library to work. There is no default feature.

In addition to having the Rust toolchain setup and dfx, you need to install the `wasi2ic` tool that replaces WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) specific function calls with their corresponding polyfill implementations. This allows you to run Wasm binaries compiled for wasm32-wasi on the Internet Computer.

```bash
cargo install wasi2ic
```

### Configure dfx.json
You also need to configure your `dfx.json` to compile for the `wasm32-wasip1` target and use `wasi2ic` to process the binary:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "your_canister": {
      "candid": "your_canister.did",
      "package": "your_canister",
      "type": "custom",
      "build": [
        "cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release",
        "wasi2ic target/wasm32-wasip1/release/your_canister.wasm target/wasm32-wasip1/release/your_canister-wasi2ic.wasm"
      ],
      "wasm": "target/wasm32-wasip1/release/your_canister-wasi2ic.wasm"
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation

Add to both `[dependencies]` and `[build-dependencies]` in your `Cargo.toml`:

### For SQLite support (most common for ICP):
```toml
[dependencies]
# Note: You MUST specify either "sqlite" or "turso" feature - there is no default
ic-sql-migrate = { version = "0.0.4", features = ["sqlite"] }
ic-rusqlite = { version = "0.4.2", features = ["precompiled"], default-features = false }
ic-cdk = "0.18.7"

[build-dependencies]
ic-sql-migrate = "0.0.4"
```

### For Turso support:
```toml
[dependencies]
# Note: You MUST specify either "sqlite" or "turso" feature - there is no default
ic-sql-migrate = { version = "0.0.4", features = ["turso"] }
turso = "0.1.4"
ic-cdk = "0.18.7"

[build-dependencies]
ic-sql-migrate = "0.0.4"
```

**Important:**
- You **MUST** choose exactly one database feature (`sqlite` or `turso`)
- The features are mutually exclusive (cannot use both)
- There is no default feature - the library will not work without selecting one

## Deployment Configuration

### dfx.json Setup
For SQLite support, you need to configure your `dfx.json` to compile for the `wasm32-wasip1` target and use `wasi2ic` to process the binary:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "your_canister": {
      "candid": "your_canister.did",
      "package": "your_canister",
      "type": "custom",
      "build": [
        "cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release",
        "wasi2ic target/wasm32-wasip1/release/your_canister.wasm target/wasm32-wasip1/release/your_canister-wasi2ic.wasm"
      ],
      "wasm": "target/wasm32-wasip1/release/your_canister-wasi2ic.wasm"
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration:
1. Compiles your canister for the `wasm32-wasip1` target (required for SQLite)
2. Uses `wasi2ic` to convert WASI function calls to IC-compatible polyfills
3. Points dfx to the processed WASM file for deployment

## Quick Start

### 1. Create migration files

Create a `migrations` directory in your project root and add SQL files:

```
migrations/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001_initial.sql
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 002_add_users.sql
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 003_add_indexes.sql
```

Example migration file (`migrations/001_initial.sql`):
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. Set up build.rs

Create a `build.rs` file in your project root:

```rust
fn main() {
    // This will embed all SQL files from the migrations directory
    ic_sql_migrate::list(Some("migrations")).unwrap();
}
```

### 3. Use in your canister

#### SQLite Example (with ic-rusqlite):

```rust
use ic_cdk::{init, post_upgrade, pre_upgrade};
use ic_rusqlite::{close_connection, with_connection, Connection};

// Include all migrations at compile time
static MIGRATIONS: &[ic_sql_migrate::Migration] = ic_sql_migrate::include!();

fn run_migrations() {
    with_connection(|mut conn| {
        let conn: &mut Connection = &mut conn;
        ic_sql_migrate::sqlite::up(conn, MIGRATIONS).unwrap();
    });
}

#[init]
fn init() {
    run_migrations();
}

#[pre_upgrade]
fn pre_upgrade() {
    close_connection();
}

#[post_upgrade]
fn post_upgrade() {
    run_migrations();
}
```

#### Turso Example:

```rust
use ic_cdk::{init, post_upgrade, pre_upgrade};
use turso::Connection;
use std::cell::RefCell;

static MIGRATIONS: &[ic_sql_migrate::Migration] = ic_sql_migrate::include!();

thread_local! {
    static CONNECTION: RefCell<Option<Connection>> = const { RefCell::new(None) };
}

async fn get_connection() -> Connection {
    // Initialize or return existing connection
    // See examples/turso for complete implementation
}

async fn run_migrations() {
    let mut conn = get_connection().await;
    ic_sql_migrate::turso::up(&mut conn, MIGRATIONS).await.unwrap();
}

#[init]
async fn init() {
    // Initialize memory/storage (see examples)
    run_migrations().await;
}

#[pre_upgrade]
fn pre_upgrade() {
    CONNECTION.with_borrow_mut(|c| *c = None);
}

#[post_upgrade]
async fn post_upgrade() {
    // Re-initialize memory/storage
    run_migrations().await;
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Build Time**: The `list()` function in `build.rs` scans your migrations directory and generates code to embed all SQL files into your canister binary.

2. **WASI to IC Conversion**: The `wasi2ic` tool converts WASI-specific function calls to IC-compatible polyfills, allowing the WASM binary to run on the Internet Computer.

3. **Canister Init/Upgrade**:
   - On `init`: Runs all migrations to set up the database schema
   - On `post_upgrade`: Runs any new migrations added since the last deployment

4. **Migration Tracking**: A `_migrations` table is automatically created to track which migrations have been applied, preventing duplicate execution.

5. **Transaction Safety**: All pending migrations run in a single transaction. If any migration fails, all changes are rolled back.

## Migration Best Practices

1. **Naming Convention**: Use sequential numbering like `001_description.sql`, `002_description.sql` to ensure correct execution order

2. **Forward-Only**: This library only supports forward migrations (no rollbacks). Plan your schema changes carefully.

3. **Idempotent SQL**: While migrations are tracked, write idempotent SQL when possible using `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses

4. **Small Changes**: Keep each migration focused on a single logical change

5. **Test Locally**: Always test migrations using `dfx deploy --local` before mainnet deployment

## Examples

Complete working examples are available in the repository:

- [`examples/sqlite`](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-sql-migrate/tree/main/examples/sqlite) - ICP canister with SQLite
- [`examples/turso`](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-sql-migrate/tree/main/examples/turso) - ICP canister with Turso

### Running the SQLite Example

```bash
cd examples/sqlite
dfx start --clean
dfx deploy
dfx canister call sqlite run '()'
```

## API Reference

### Core Functions

#### For SQLite
```rust
pub fn up(conn: &mut rusqlite::Connection, migrations: &[Migration]) -> MigrateResult<()>
```
Executes all pending migrations synchronously.

#### For Turso
```rust
pub async fn up(conn: &mut turso::Connection, migrations: &[Migration]) -> MigrateResult<()>
```
Executes all pending migrations asynchronously.

### Build Script Function

```rust
pub fn list(migrations_dir_name: Option<&str>) -> std::io::Result<()>
```
Discovers and embeds migration files at compile time. Call this in `build.rs`.

### Macros

#### `ic_sql_migrate::include!()`
Includes all migrations discovered by `list()` at compile time.

### Types

#### `Migration`
```rust
pub struct Migration {
    pub id: &'static str,    // Unique identifier (filename without extension)
    pub sql: &'static str,   // SQL statements to execute
}
```

#### `Error`
Custom error type that wraps database-specific errors and migration failures.

## Migration Table Schema

The library automatically creates this table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE _migrations (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    applied_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Library doesn't compile / "module not found" errors
You **must** enable either the `sqlite` or `turso` feature in your `Cargo.toml`. The library has no default features and will not work without explicitly selecting a database backend.

### "Both features enabled" error
You can only use one database backend at a time. Remove one of the features.

### Migrations not found
Ensure your migrations directory exists and contains `.sql` files, and that `build.rs` is properly configured.

### Migration failures
Check the canister logs with `dfx canister logs <canister_name>` for detailed error messages.
